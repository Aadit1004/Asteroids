# **Void Rocks**
A 2D space shooter inspired by the classic Atari game, 'Asteroids'.


## About the Project
Void Rocks is a 2D space shooter game inspired by the classic 2D game [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)), created by [Atari](https://atari.com/). I chose this project because I wanted to hone and practice my Unity Skills. I had never created a full 2D game so I also gave myself the challenge to create the sprites myself, since I am not an artist or 3D modeler. I used the application [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) to create the pixel art sprites and got the [background](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/dynamic-space-background-lite-104606) from the Unity Asset Store. The final technologies I used in this project were Unity, C#, Piskel, Microsoft Visual Studio 2022, and Git/GitHub.


## Features
This project aims to expand upon the traditional "Asteroids" game by introducing enhanced space threats, power-ups, and diversified challenges.

### Game Modes
Three distinct gameplay modes have been developed to test player's skills and to provide differentiated gameplay experiences:

- #### Normal
  - A standard gameplay iteration, offering players three lives with an unrestricted time frame to achieve the highest scores.
- #### Time Attack
  - A time-constrained mode designed to test player adaptability under temporal pressure. Players can select challenge durations: 1, 3, or 5 minutes, each accompanied by three lives.
- #### Survival
  - An endurance-focused mode, challenging players to obtain the highest possible score while operating under the constraint of a single life.
    
### Space Threats
To enrich the gameplay environment, multiple space threats have been included:

- #### Asteroids
  - Traditional space obstacles which require either navigation or elimination. Their constant on-screen presence serves as the foundational gameplay challenge.
- #### Space Bombs
  - These threats introduce a timed challenge. Characterized by their limited lifespan, they end in an explosion. Player interaction is necessary either to maintain distance or to eliminate them.
- #### Black Holes
  - Infrequent yet high-threat entities. Their gravitational pull necessitates rapid decision-making on the player's part for elimination or evasion.
  
### Power-Ups
Several power-ups have been crafted to provide players with periodic enhancements, offering strategic gameplay advantages for a limited duration:

- #### Shield
  - A protective overlay implemented to temporarily safeguard the player's spacecraft against Asteroids and Space Bombs while active.
- #### Rapid Burst
  - An enhancement to the spacecraft's firing mechanism. The Spaceship has a rapid-fire mechanism allowing for accelerated missile firing. 
- #### Slow Motion
  - A rare but powerful enhancement to momentarily slowing down all the on-screen threats. While the player's spacecraft maintains its standard speed, the player gains a tactical advantage in navigation and targeting.
