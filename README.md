# **Asteroids
A recreation of the classic game Asteroids made in Unity

## About the Project
This is a recreation on the classic 2D game [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) since I felt that it could be a quick and simple project to implement in Unity. I chose this project
because I wanted to hone and practice my Unity skills, even though it is a basic game. I also gave the challenge, since I am not an artist or a 3d modeler, to create the ship and asteroids myself. I used the website 
[Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) to create the pixel art sprites and got the background from the Unity Asset Store. The technologies I used in this are Unity and C#.
